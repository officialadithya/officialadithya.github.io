I am an honors mathematics, applied mathematics, and computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, including algorithmic economics, computational social choice theory, fine-grained complexity, and error-correcting codes for matrix multiplication.

I am currently working to understand liquidity provisioning in automated market makers, with applications to prediction markets for Arrow-Debreu securities and decentralized exchanges. In addition, I am also working on a project involving using techniques from coding theory to develop fast and efficient matrix multiplication verification algorithms. 


At this time, I hope for an academic career in theoretical computer science. I am an Undergraduate Researcher advised by [Rafael Frongillo](https://raf.prof) and [Huck Bennett](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~hbennett/). I will be applying to computer science Ph. D. programs in Fall 2025, hoping to start in Fall 2026.

I am not Aditya Bhaskara, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah.
