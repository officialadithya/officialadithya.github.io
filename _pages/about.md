I am an honors mathematics and computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and algorithmic economics. Currently, I am seeking to understand liquidity provisioning in automated market makers, with applications to prediction markets for Arrow-Debreu securities and decentralized exchanges. I would like to learn more about computational social choice and complexity theory.

At this time, I hope for an academic career in theoretical computer science. I am an Undergraduate Researcher advised by [Rafael Frongillo](https://raf.prof).

I am not Aditya Bhaskara, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah.
