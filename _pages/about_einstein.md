I am a mathematics and computer science undergraduate at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and algorithmic economics. I hope to learn more about computational social choice theory and computational complexity theory as well. 

At this time, I hope for an academic career in theoretical computer science. I am an Undergraduate Researcher advised by Rafael Frongillo.

I am not Aditya Bhaskara, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah.
