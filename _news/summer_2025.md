Thanks to the Boettcher Foundation's Educational Enrichment Grant, I will be attending [STOC'25](https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2025/) in Prague, Czechia from June 23 to June 27, 2025. I'm also excited to attend [The Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School in Computer Science (CMMRS)](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany from July 27 to August 3, 2025. I appreciate both the Boettcher Foundation and CMMRS for fully funding these opportunities.
