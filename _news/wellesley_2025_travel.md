I will be attending [Social Choice: Theory and Computation An Interdisciplinary Conference on Voting, Representation, and Districting](https://mathematics-democracy-institute.org/2025-social-choice-conference/), organized by the [Institute for Mathematics and Democracy](https://mathematics-democracy-institute.org) at Wellesley College from October 15 to October 17! I'm excited to both catch up with some friends and meet new people!
