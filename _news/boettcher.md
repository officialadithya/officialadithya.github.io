I am honored to receive the Boettcher Scholarship, a full-ride scholarship given to 50 Colorado high school seniors. This scholarship is awarded annually on the basis of superior scholastic ability and intellectual curiosity, evidence of leadership and involvement, service to community and school, and outstanding character.
