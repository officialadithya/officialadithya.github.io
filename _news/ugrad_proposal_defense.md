I defended my proposal for my undergraduate thesis! The title of my talk was "No Representation Without Randomization! Tradeoffs Between Randomness, Representation, Manipulation-Robustness, and
Other Desiderata for Sortition Algorithms." I am very thankful to my thesis commitee: [Bailey Flanigan](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/bailey-flanigan/home), [Rafael Frongillo](https://raf.prof), [Joshua Strayhorn](https://www.colorado.edu/polisci/people/faculty/joshua-strayhorn), and [Bo Waggoner](https://www.bowaggoner.com).
